Here's how to update this font whenever Amber updates the zip file.

At the time of writing, the zip file is found in Google Drive:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2crMLkmt3O9ejJ5SlNjYkNHTTA

Download the zip file, and place it in this directory (zorroa-icons/). If there's a zip file already here, overwrite it.

Make sure you don't have any staged git files, then...
Run these commands (OSX) from the fonts/zorroa-icons directory:

unzip -o zorroa-icons.zip
git add -- .
git commit -m "Update zorroa-icons"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

To preview the fonts and make sure you have the glyphs you expect:
open demo.html (after unzipping the new zip file)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the long explanation, for posterity

Unzip the file, allowing it to overwrite whatever's here.

For example:

[src/assets/fonts/zorroa-icons] > unzip zorroa-icons.zip
Archive:  zorroa-icons.zip
replace selection.json? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: A
 extracting: selection.json
 extracting: fonts/zorroa-icons.ttf
 extracting: fonts/zorroa-icons.woff
 extracting: fonts/zorroa-icons.eot
 extracting: fonts/zorroa-icons.svg
 extracting: demo.html
 extracting: demo-files/demo.js
 extracting: demo-files/demo.css
 extracting: Read Me.txt
 extracting: fonts/zorroa-icons.woff2
 extracting: style.css

Now commit the changes.

[src/assets/fonts/zorroa-icons] > git add -- .

The .gitignore file should already be ignoring everything that doesn't belong in source control.
